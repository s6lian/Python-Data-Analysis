# Python-Data-Analysis

1. Data Summarization 
dataset: breast-cancer-wisconsin
code: calculate the mean,mode skew, standard deviation, variation of each column && PCC of several pairs of columns 
      && draw histograms of two features


2. Data Normalization
dataset:wine-quality.csv
code: normalize data with  min-max normalized values, z-score normalized values, mean subtracted normalized values
      && for each of the first 10 data points report the nearest and farthest out of the other first 10 
      points using the manhatten distance, euclidean distance and cosine distance


3. Data Decompostion
dataset:communities.data
code:Load the crime dataset and store it as a matrix (The data is already normalized )  
    && Compute the eigen vectors and eigen values 
    && Report a table with the top 20 eigenvalues, decide whether we can cut off the dimensions from these eigen values
